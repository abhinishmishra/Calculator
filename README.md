I built this modern and responsive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my web development practice. The structure of the calculator is designed with HTML, while CSS gives it a sleek, dark-themed interface with glowing buttons and smooth layout. JavaScript handles all the logic, including input processing, arithmetic operations, and dynamic screen updates. This project helped me improve my skills in designing interactive user interfaces and implementing real-time functionality in web applications.
